# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Learning:

1) Difference in Create-React-App and Vite App
2) JSX vs JS ; In JSX we return HTML
3) We should always begin the component name and its file with Capital Case (Best Practice)
4) How React uses Virtual DOM
5) React creates SOP (Single Page Application)
6) We learnt that how React converts the JSX (HTML) and stores it in an object and then uses that object to render. Obviously there are more optimization under the hood
7) Using React.createElement
